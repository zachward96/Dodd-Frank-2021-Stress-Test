# Dodd-Frank-2021-Stress-Test

The goal of this notebook is to recreate a table found in the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test 2021 published by the Federal Reserve.

This table shows hypothetical credit card accounts with variables including Credit Card Type (divided into General Purpose and Private Label), Credit Card Limit (>= 1,500, 1,501 - 7,500, > 7,500) and Product Type (Co-brand and Other).

The table then seperates columns by Lower-risk, Typical and Higher-risk. 

I will recreate this in a dataframe so that the information is able to be indexed and easily selected for future applications.
